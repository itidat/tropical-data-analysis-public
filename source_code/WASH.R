################ WASH CLASSIFICATION CHANGES ################
#############################################################

# v1 surveys used the original GTMP/Tropical Data methodology; v2 surveys used the 2019 updated Tropical Data methodology; v3 surveys used the 2023 updated Tropical Data methodology
# w1_drink_agg: water source type 10 - 'Delivered water (water vendor)' counted as unimproved prior to the 2019 methodology update 
# due to the change described above, if you are analysing v1 EUs, w1_drink_agg might be higher than the final/approved analysis result
# the magnitude of the difference will depend on the number of households in the EU with that water source type

# s2_latrine_agg: latrine type 4 'Flush/pour flush to open drains' counted as improved prior to the 2019 methodology update
# due to the change described above, if you are analysing v1 EUs, s2_latrine_agg may be lower than the final/approved analysis result
# the magnitude of the difference will depend on the number of households in the EU with that latrine type
